**TryTasty** is a creative recipe platform sharing fun and tasty snack ideas using simple, easy-to-find ingredients — with a special love for plantain!

Originally launched as a student learning project, **TryTasty** is now evolving into a **social food-sharing platform** where users can create accounts, post their own recipes, like and comment on others’ creations, and discover unique snacks from around the world.

This project is part of **Scybud**, a student-led creative brand exploring tech, science, and design.
